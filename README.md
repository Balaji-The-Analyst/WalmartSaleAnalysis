### Insights
* Gender per branch is more or less the same hence, I don't think has an effect of the sales per branch and other factors.
* Looks like time of the day does not really affect the rating, its more or less the same rating each time of the day.
* Branch A and C are doing well in ratings, branch B needs to do a  little more to get better ratings.
* Mon, Tue and Friday are the top best days for good ratings.
* Evenings experience most sales, the stores are filled during the evening hours.
